# json-template
in some cases, we will write a lot of json files. They may have lots of similar part, so i come up an idea
to use json-template reduce the unnecessary repetition. i extend json language with two simple concepts.


## $extend

## pipe with [jmespath](https://jmespath.org/)

## extra
* recommend use .jsont as suffix file name
* https://jmespath.org/
